        This method should only be used by tests that need to connect a
        callback to a widget signal before the app window, which contains
        all app widgets, has been created.

        Note that the window is not created in the Gtk.Application constructor
        but when the app receives the ``activate`` signal. Fore more info:
        https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/GtkApplication

        While testing, we might want to use this method to make sure that we
        are able to connect our callback **before** the signal has already
        fired. This method allows the app to queue a
        request to connect a callback to one of the widgets' signals. The queued
        request will be processed as soon as the app window (with all its
        children widgets) have been created.

        Usage example:
        .. code-block:: python
            with AsyncExecutor() as executor:
                app = App(executor)
                app.queue_signal_connect(
                    signal_spec="main_widget.vpn_widget.servers_widget::server-list-ready",
                    callback=my_func
                )
                sys.exit(app.run(sys.argv))

        The widget/signal the callback should be connected to is specified
        with the ``signal_spec`` parameter, which should have the following
        form: ``widget_attr.[widget_attr.]::signal-name``.

        ``widget_attr`` refers to a widget attribute from the app window
        which, in turn, can contain other widget attributes. The ``signal-name``
        after the double colon is the name of the signal to attach the callback
        to.

        So in the example above, the resulting action once the app window is
        created will be to run the following code:

        .. code-block:: python
            app.window.main_widget.vpn_widget.servers.connect(
                "server-list-ready", my_func
            )

        :param signal_spec: signal specification.
        :param callback: Callback to connect to the specified signal.
